# Full stack GraphQL airbnb clone 

A Fullstack GraphQL Airbnb Clone with Next.js and React Native.

### Structure 
This project is made up of 4 areas that share code using <a href='https://lerna.js.org/' target="_blank">Lerna</a>

* Server - GraphQL, Typescript server 
* app - React Native app 
* web - Next.js frontend website
* common - Common functionality used across the server, app & web 


## Getting started with local development 

### Prerequisites
* This project targets Node V14. Ensure you're using Node V14 by using something such as NVM. 
* Ensure you have Node / NPM installed.
* Ensure Postgres is installed & is running (see backend section for more details)
* Ensure Redis is installed & is running (see backend section for more details)
* Ensure your postgres user has superuser access on the `abb-clone` DB
* Run `npm ci && npm run bootstrap` in the root of the project to bootstrap the packages, install all their dependencies and link any cross-dependencies.


### Backend: 

* [Install postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
* [Install Redis (stable)](https://redis.io/download)
* Create a blank postgres database called `abb-clone`
* copy the `.env.example ` to `.env` (`cp .env.example .env`).
* Fill out the `.env` file with your own values
* to start the backend: `cd src/abb-server && npm run watch`. This will transpile Typescript down to common JS. Run `npm run dev` to start the backend server. 

    ### Migrations 
    * The backend contains 2 commands which are responsible for dealing with migrations. 
    * The first one is responsible for generating a migration based on changes made to the `entities` folder. `typeorm migration:generate -n <NAME>`. 
    * The second one is responsible for running the generated migrations. `typeorm migration:run`
    * In development we auto-synchronize any updates made to the database. This is to avoid having to manually run migrations everytime we make schema changes. When in a production setting we run migrations manully (if there are any model changes to be made) by using the following logic: 
    ```
    process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ?? (await conn.runMigrations());
    ```


### Frontend: 
* copy the `.env.example ` to `.env`. `cp .env.example .env`. 
* Fill out the `.env` file with your own values
* run `npm run dev` to start the frontend


### App: 
* copy the `.env.example ` to `.env`. `cp .env.example .env`. 
* Fill out the `.env` file with your own values
* run `npm run start` to start the expo app

### Features
* Protected routes (web, app & backend)
* register, login & logout (web & app)
* CRUD properties (web & app)
* CRUD user (web & app)
* CRUD reviews (web & app)
* image uploads to S3
* Deployment via AWS EKS fargate and Vercel
